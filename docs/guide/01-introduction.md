## Background

The wallet is 100% free (and the core product will remain so), but in future we might add enterprise features, which will come at a cost.

## Privacy and Security

### Non-Custodial

Solar is a self-custodial wallet. That means your secret key is never disclosed to anyone. This way we help you keep the secret key safe, so no one except you will ever be able to control the funds in your wallet.
